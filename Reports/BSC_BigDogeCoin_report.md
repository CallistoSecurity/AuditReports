# 3. Findings

In total, **1 issues** were reported, including:

- 0 high severity issues.

- 0 medium severity issues.

- 1 low severity issues.

In total, **9 notes** were reported, including:

- 3 notes.

- 6 owner privileges.

No critical security issues were found.

## 3.1. Possible incorrect message in `require` function.

### Severity: note

### Description

In the line 466 `require(now > _lockTime , "Contract is locked until 7 days");` the message indicates a specific locking period, but function `function lock()` (line 456) allow to lock to any period.

### Recommendation

Replace with message without specific locking period.

## 3.2. No excluded accounts - unused code.

### Severity: note

### Description

The variables in lines 701-702 is declared but never initialized and there are no functions to initialize them.
```Solidity
    mapping (address => bool) private _isExcluded;
    address[] private _excluded;
```

Therefore contract could not have excluded from rewards addresses, and numbers of functions and its part are unused:
1. Part of code in function `balanceOf` (line 791)
2. Function `isExcludedFromReward` (lines 825-827)
3. Part of code in function `deliver` (line 835)
4. Part of code in function `_takeLiquidity` (lines 951-952)
5. Part of code in function `_tokenTransfer` (lines 1101-1109)
6. Function `_transferToExcluded` (lines 1126-1144)
7. Function `_transferFromExcluded` (lines 1136-1144)
8. Function `_transferBothExcluded` (lines 860-869)
9. Part of code in function `_getCurrentSupply` (lines 938-943)

### Recommendation

To increase readability and reduce deployment cost the unused code should be removed.

## 3.3. ERC20 Complines - transfer 0 value should be allowed

### Severity: low

### Description

Due [ERC20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20): `Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event.`

### Recommendation

Remove `require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");` (line 1001).

## 3.4. Unused variable `mintedByDxsale`

### Severity: note

### Description

The variable `mintedByDxsale` (line 708) was declared but never used. 

### Recommendation

To increase readability and reduce deployment cost the unused code should be removed.

## 3.5. Owner privileges

### Severity: owner privileges

### Description

Contract owner has right to:

1. Exclude/include any account from/in fee, using functions `excludeFromFee` (lines 871-873) and `includeInFee` (lines 875-877).
2. Change tax fee in range from 0 to `maxTaxFee` percent, using function `setTaxFeePercent` (lines 879-878).
3. Change liquidity fee in range from 0 to `maxLiqFee` percent, using function `setLiquidityFeePercent` (lines 884-887).
4. Change maximal amount per transaction in range from `minMxTxPercentage` to 100 percent of total supply, using function `setMaxTxPercent` (lines 889-894).
5. Enable or disable adding liquidity to pool, using function `setSwapAndLiquifyEnabled` (lines 896-899).
6. Enable or disable all fees and transaction amount limit, using functions `disableFees` (lines 1146-1154) and `enableFees` (lines 1156-1161).


# 4. Security practices

- [x] **Open-source contact**.
- [ ] **The contract should pass a bug bounty after the completion of the security audit.**
- [ ] **Public testing.**
- [ ] **Automated anomaly detection systems.** - NOT IMPLEMENTED. A simple anomaly detection algorithm is recommended to be implemented to detect behavior that is atypical compared to normal for this contract. For instance, the contract must halt deposits in case a large amount is being withdrawn in a short period of time until the owner or the community of the contract approves further operations.
- [ ] **Multisig owner account.**
- [ ] **Standard ERC20-related issues.** - NOT IMPLEMENTED. It is known that every contract can potentially receive an unintended ERC20-token deposit without the ability to reject it even if the contract is not intended to receive or hold tokens. As a result, it is recommended to implement a function that will allow extracting any arbitrary number of tokens from the contract.
- [ ] **Crosschain address collisions.** ETH, ETC, CLO, etc. It is possible that a transaction can be sent to the address of your contract at another chain (as a result of a user mistake or some software fault). It is recommended that you deploy a "mock contract" that would allow you to withdraw any tokens from that address or prevent any funds deposits. Note that you can reject transactions of native token deposited, but you can not reject the deposits of ERC20 tokens. You can use this source code as a mock contract: [extractor contract source code](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/GNT-emergency-extractor-contract/blob/master/extractor.sol). The address of a new contract deployed using `CREATE (0xf0)` opcode is assigned following this scheme `keccak256(rlp([sender, nonce]))`. Therefore you need to use the same address that was originally used at the main chain to deploy the mock contract at a transaction with the `nonce` that matches that on the original chain. _Example: If you have deployed your main contract with address 0x010101 at your 2021th transaction then you need to increase your nonce of 0x010101 address to 2020 at the chain where your mock contract will be deployed. Then you can deploy your mock contract with your 2021th transaction, and it will receive the same address as your mainnet contract._

# 5. Conclusion

The audited smart contract can be deployed. Only low severity issues were found during the audit.

It is recommended to adhere to the security practices described in pt. 4 of this report to ensure the contract's operability and prevent any issues that are not directly related to the code of this smart contract.
