## 3.1. Known vulnerabilities of ERC-20 token

### Severity: low

### Description

1. It is possible to double withdrawal attack. More details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit).

2. Lack of transaction handling mechanism issue. [WARNING!](https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/ddb3e89fe64bf2e06ed15fbd5679bd20)  This is a very common issue and it already caused millions of dollars losses for lots of token users! More details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Feh5sP6oQL1-1NHi-X1dbgT3ch2WdhbXRevDN681Jv4/edit).
