# 3. Findings

In total, **7 issues** were reported including:

- 2 low severity issues.

- 5 owner privileges (ability of owner to manipulate contract, may be risky for investors).

No critical security issues were found.

## 3.1. Known vulnerabilities of ERC-20 token

### Severity: low

### Description

1. It is possible to double withdrawal attack. More details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit).

2. Lack of transaction handling mechanism issue. [WARNING!](https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/ddb3e89fe64bf2e06ed15fbd5679bd20)  This is a very common issue and it already caused millions of dollars losses for lots of token users! More details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Feh5sP6oQL1-1NHi-X1dbgT3ch2WdhbXRevDN681Jv4/edit).

### Recommendation

Add the following code to the `transfer(_to address, ...)` function:

```
require( _to != address(this) );

```

## 3.2. Array Size

### Severity: low

### Description

In `drop` function member of `AsureBounty` contract, `recipients` and `values` arrays length should be checked if they are the same length. 

### Code snippet

https://github.com/AsureNetwork/crowdsale/blob/50cfbe81c88ba9be85419cc191298872435c4615/packages/crowdsale/contracts/AsureBounty.sol#L16

## 3.3. Inconsistencies with Asure Token Generation Event.

### Severity: owner privileges

### Description

1. According to the [whitepaper](https://www.asure.network/asure.network.tge.en.pdf),  specified parameters of soft cup and hard cap, but in code we can't see these functions.

2. According to the [whitepaper] the Asure Team and Advisors will receive their tokens over two years after the start of the second phase,  but in constructor of AsureCrowdsaleDeployer contract we can't see the Teams and Advisor vesting parameters. 

3. According to the [whitepaper] the minimum Contribution is $ 100 (ETH equivalent), but we can't see this parameter in code.

The contract is managed manually by the owner which is not good for investors.

## 3.4. Owner Privileges

### Severity: owner privileges

### Description

The contract owner allow himself to:

1. update bonus rate, bonus time, crowdsale time and default rate before crowdsale opened.

2. withdraw ETH and tokens funds before the end of sales.

The contract is managed manually by the owner which is not good for investors.


# 4. Conclusion

The audited smart contract can be deployed. Only low severity issues were found during the audit.
