# 3. Findings

In total, **2 issues** were reported including:

- 1 notes.

- 1 owner privileges (ability of owner to manipulate contract, may be risky for investors).

No critical security issues were found.

## 3.1. Gas Consumption  

### Severity: note

### Description

### Code snippet

`statementIdsByBuildingPermit` and `getAllStatements` functions members of `StatementRegistery` contract contain a loop that might make the externals calls throw even if marked as `view`, the nodes that will run the request will need to be set with a higher gas limit for view function. If the node is public and the internal gas limit is high then an attacker can use it for a DoS attack.

This issue do not represent a direct risk, but it should be noted.

## 3.2. Controller Redeployment

### Severity: owner privileges

### Description

This issue was presented as ["3.4. The relocating is not a secure process for investors"](https://gist.github.com/yuriy77k/ba8317d2aeefeeff9b8fb7f23a68f5d0#34-the-relocating-is-not-secure-process-for-investors) in the first audit.

Since the UI will use `Controller` contract to request `StatementRegistery` that will write in the eternal storage (`dataStore`), the user should get the address of the `StatementRegistery` contract once the procedure is done in the case if the controller contract is redeployed and `StatementRegistery` address is reset to a new one (or any other possibility in the near or far future). Please note that at the moment only `statementId` is returned by `recordStatement` member of `Controller` contract.

Eternal storage should also be found by the users, otherwise they will not be able to prove that their construction permit was visible.

# 4. Conclusion

The audited smart contract can be deployed. Only low severity issues were found during the audit.
