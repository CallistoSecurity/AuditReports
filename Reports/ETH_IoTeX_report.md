# 3. Findings

In total, **2 issues** were reported including:

- 1 low severity issues.

- 1 owner privileges (the ability of an owner to manipulate contract, may be risky for investors).

No critical security issues were found.

## 3.1. Known vulnerabilities of ERC-20 token

### Severity: low

### Description

1. It is possible to double withdrawal attack. More details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit).

2. Lack of transaction handling mechanism issue. [WARNING!](https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/ddb3e89fe64bf2e06ed15fbd5679bd20)  This is a very common issue and it already caused millions of dollars losses for lots of token users! More details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Feh5sP6oQL1-1NHi-X1dbgT3ch2WdhbXRevDN681Jv4/edit).

### Recommendation

Add the following code to the `transfer(_to address, ...)` function:

```
require( _to != address(this) );

```

## 3.2. Owner Privileges

### Severity: owner previliges

### Description
Contract owner allow himself to:

to pause functions of contract (transfer, transferFrom, approve, increaseApproval, decreaseApproval) [here](https://github.com/iotexproject/IOTX-token-contracts/blob/13b1b1053529effce653deabfec427b70800eb42/contracts/lifecycle/Pausable.sol#L21).

# 4. Conclusion

The audited smart contract can be deployed. Only low severity issues were found during the audit.
